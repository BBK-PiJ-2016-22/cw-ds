Creating this code I made the choice of storing the items wrapped in ReturnObject inside ArrayList and LinkedList. 
I could also have chosen to add the items boxed in Object and wrap them in ReturnObject upon retrieval.
I found the instructions on this part of the task ambiguous, but chose the approach as described above.
I made this particular choice based on the fact that most getter functions are clean and all they do is retrieve an object.
I have included the other solution as well, and the files are placed in the folder named extra.


Despite the instructions of not using external libraries I chose to create JUnittests and inlude these, 
they are not a part of the submission as such but a mereextra for the sake of praticing JUnit.
