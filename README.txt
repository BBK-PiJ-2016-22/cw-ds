Creating this code I made the choice of storing the items wrapped in ReturnObject inside ArrayList and LinkedList. I could also have chosen to add the items boxed in Object and wrap them in ReturnObject upon retrieval.

Despite the instructions of not using external libraries I chose to create JUnittests and inlude these, they are not a part of the submission as such but a mereextra for the sake of praticing JUnit.
